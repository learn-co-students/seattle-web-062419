# Palindrome Syndrome

### Introduction
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards and forwards.

### Problem Statement
Write out the method `palindrome?()` that takes in a string as an argument and determines whether that string is a palindrome.

### Example

* `palindrome?("racecar")` gives a boolean output of **true** because "racecar" is a palindrome.
* `palindrome?("flatiron")` gives a boolean output of **false** because "flatiron" is not a palindrome.

What would the output for the following strings be?
* `palindrome?("noon")`
* `palindrome?("five")`
* `palindrome?("radar")`
* `palindrome?("learnlovecode")`

*Note that the `palindrome.rb` file combines all the methods and compares run time using Ruby's built-in Time method. Run this file using `ruby palindrome.rb`.*
